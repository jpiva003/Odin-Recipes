    <h1>Torrijas (Spain)</h1>
    <img src="image2.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Torrijas are a classic Spanish dessert similar to French toast. They are
      made from slices of stale bread soaked in milk or wine, coated in egg, and
      then fried until golden. After frying, they are often sweetened with
      honey, sugar, and cinnamon. Torrijas are traditionally enjoyed during Holy
      Week (Semana Santa) but can be found in Spanish bakeries and homes
      throughout the year.
